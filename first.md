# The Making of an Accidental Developer

People who go to college later in life, not immediately after high school, are typically known as non-traditional students. You could easily consider me to be a "non-traditional" developer. By the time I started writing any kind of code I was nearly 30 years old and married, with a kid. It was another year before I started doing anything that could be considered software development. I landed my first full time software development job in July 2013, at the ripe age of 31.
