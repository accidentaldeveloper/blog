# Languages I Want to Learn

1. F#

	Strong compile time checks, type inference, reliable programs, and clean code are all near and dear to my heart. Object-oriented languages are the standard these days, but they leave something to be desired. I've heard enough about the benefits of functional programming to know that it's an area I need to explore

2. PowerShell

	Well built software is useless if you can't deploy it. As I learn more about the details of deploying a complex application I've discovered that PowerShell is an essential part of the Windows developer's tool box. I've dabbled in PowerShell but my expertise is mostly limited to modifying existing scripts.

	As a side effect, I'm hoping to improve my confidence with the command line and scripting languages in general


3. TypeScript/ES6

	As I've improved my C# skills over the past few years, I've come to lean heavily on the language's compile time checks. When I see the green bar that indicates a successful compile, it gives me confidence that my code will do what I want, the first time. That's not to say that I never have to debug or fix my code, but the vast majority of the errors are recognized before I ever attempt to run the code.

	When I venture into client side code I get none of the same assurances. This was annoying but acceptable when my most complex JavaScript code consisted of simple click handlers and

	<code type="javascript">

		$("#myInput").click(function (){ $("#myId").addClass("myClass"); });
	</code>
